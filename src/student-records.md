title: Viewing student records
---

Student records can be viewed from the following navigations (view - top tab):
- *School view* - *Student TT*
- *Special Education view* - *Student TT*
- *Special Education view* - *IEP TT*

# Active (current) students

Within School view, you can view active students by selecting the *All Active Students* filter. Within Special Education view, you can view active students by selecting the *Enrollment Status = Active* filter. If you would like these filters to be the default way you look at the student lists, see [here for instructions to set default filters and field sets](basics/filters-and-field-sets.md#setting-defaults-for-a-given-page).

# Inactive students

Across views, you can see previous student records by selecting *All Records*.

# A note about *All Records*

As a general rule, if you don't like fiddling back and forth between active and inactive filters, you can always default to using *All Records* and then using search or sort to find the particular data you're interested in.

# Students currently enrolled in another program
Typically if a student has been moved to another program you should coordinate with their new teacher or TC, or access them within their new school (if youâ€™re still the current teacher or TC) to make any required updates. However there are some exceptions to this rule. If you find you still need access to a student record and they are not viewable as either an [active](#active-current-students) or [inactive student](#inactive-students). Please reach out to an SDL or the SEIS Data Team and we will resolve the issue.
