Side tabs (ST) are the second-level navigation control in Aspen. Once you have clicked on a [top tab](top-tabs.md), you will see a list of tabs on the side that further divide the content into sub-topics. The side tabs adapt to the top tab that you pick and are not always the same across top tabs or across views.

For example, clicking the *Students* top tab might reveal the following side tabs (depending on your view):

- Details
- Contacts
- Attendance
- Transcript
- Schedule
- Documents

Whereas clicking on the *Grades* top tab might reveal the following side tabs (depending on your view):

- Grade Terms
- Transcripts
- Grade Input
- Grade Post Controls

# Sub side tabs

Some side tabs, when selected, will even have further sub side tabs (SST). These sub side tabs will appear - indented and in smaller type - underneath the main side tab once it's clicked. These serve exactly the same purpose as side tabs: to divide content up into buckets so that a user can look at exactly the data that they want to.
