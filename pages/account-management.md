# To log into Aspen

1. Enter the URL [https://ma-hec.myfollett.com](https://ma-hec.myfollett.com) into your web browser’s address bar (A bookmark should be saved on your desktop, if not bookmark here, not after you have logged in)
2. Type your Login ID and password (provided by an Aspen Administrator)
3. Click “Log On” and you will be prompted to change your password. 

# Passwords and account management

## Password creation
Your password must:

- Be at least 6 characters long
- Contain both upper and lowercase letters
- Contain at least one number
- Not contain the following:
  - the word "password"
  - your Login ID
  - your first name
  - your last name
  - your middle name
  - your date of birth
  - your personnel ID
  - sequences of letters/numbers (e.g., "123" or "abc")

When Aspen prompts you to change your password, you cannot reenter the same password.

## Setting up your account and security questions
On the first time you log in, make sure to:

- Type in your primary (work) email address. This is where password reset emails will get sent when you use the *I forgot my password* link.
- Select a security question from the dropdown menu and type your answer.
- Click *Submit*.

## When you forget your password
Aspen has an email-based password recovery system. Clicking *I forgot my password* on Aspen's login screen will email a new, one-time password to the email you entered upon [account creation](#setting-up-your-account-and-security-questions). If you have tried to log in five times with the wrong password, your account will be locked. Fortunately, clicking on the *I forgot my password* link and completing that process will unlock your account.

# Passwords and security
Aspen is our Student Information System and therefore contains a lot of confidential student data. Please treat your password with the highest level of safety and security.

- When choosing a password, choose something that would be hard for a stranger to guess
  - Good example: CorrectStapleHorseBattery7
  - Bad example: aspen1
- If your internet browser offers to save or remember the password, please select *Never for this site*
- Do not write down/print out your password on a piece of paper, sticky note, or other physical object and then leave the password taped to your monitor, in a desk drawer, tucked under your computer tower, etc.
