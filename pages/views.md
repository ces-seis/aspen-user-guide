Views change the way that you interact with Aspen by changing how "zoomed in" or "zoomed out" your access to data is. Some of the most commonly used views in Aspen, from widest (most zoomed out) to narrowest (most zoomed in) are:

| View name              | Who might need it | Common tasks                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| District view          | Administrators    | Student reports, Managing staff accounts, Working with timesheets             |
| School view            | Site coordinators | Scheduling classes                                                            |
| Staff view             | Teachers          | Taking attendance, entering grades                                            |
| Special Education view | SDLs              | Viewing IEPs/Tracking forms, SDL memos, Managing Special Education enrollment |

# View options

Some views have an additional option that affects Aspen. This usually happens when your account allows you access to multiple versions of the view you are trying to access. For example, a district administrator who enters School View will have the opportunity to select which school they want to view. Selecting one school will then show School View data for that school, while selecting another school will show School View data for that other school. Likewise, a teacher or SDL who works in multiple programs will have the ability to select from among the schools they've been granted access to. A system administrator might be able to select a staffperson from within Staff View in order to troubleshoot issues with that specific staff's view.

The view option selector, if there is one, will appear to the right of the view selector.
