# SEIS Aspen User Guide - gh-pages branch

This branch of the SEIS Aspen User Guide repository is the home of the generated website files to be published using GitHub Pages. If you are looking to make modifications to the website, this is not the correct place to do so. Go to the `main` branch (or another feature branch), and make edits there.
