        <h1>Top Tab navigation in Aspen</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Top tabs (TTs) in Aspen are the coarsest way Aspen has of navigating different types of data and tasks. These are the "large bucket" areas of things you might want to do or look at. Clicking on a top tab will change your screen and begin showing you information about the topic you chose. Once you are in a top tab you can further narrow the scope of what you are looking at by navigating through the <a href="/aspen-user-guide/basics/side-tabs/">side tabs</a>.</p>
<h1>Views affect top tabs</h1>
<p>Which <a href="/aspen-user-guide/basics/views/">view</a> you have selected in Aspen will affect the top tabs that are available and also affect what you see <em>within</em> each top tab. For example, if you are in District View and click on the Student top tab, you will see a roster of students independent of their host agency or program enrollment. This is because District View is designed to show district-wide data. On the other hand, if you are in School View, the Student top tab will only show you students that are enrolled at the particular school you have selected.</p>
