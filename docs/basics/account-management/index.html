    </header>

    <h1>To log into Aspen</h1>
<ol>
<li>Enter the URL <a href="https://ma-hec.myfollett.com">https://ma-hec.myfollett.com</a> into your web browser’s address bar (A bookmark should be saved on your desktop, if not bookmark here, not after you have logged in)</li>
<li>Type your Login ID and password (provided by an Aspen Administrator)</li>
<li>Click “Log On” and you will be prompted to change your password.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Passwords and account management</h1>
<h2>Password creation</h2>
<p>Your password must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be at least 6 characters long</li>
<li>Contain both upper and lowercase letters</li>
<li>Contain at least one number</li>
<li>Not contain the following:
<ul>
<li>the word "password"</li>
<li>your Login ID</li>
<li>your first name</li>
<li>your last name</li>
<li>your middle name</li>
<li>your date of birth</li>
<li>your personnel ID</li>
<li>sequences of letters/numbers (e.g., "123" or "abc")</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When Aspen prompts you to change your password, you cannot reenter the same password.</p>
<h2>Setting up your account and security questions</h2>
<p>On the first time you log in, make sure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type in your primary (work) email address. This is where password reset emails will get sent when you use the <em>I forgot my password</em> link.</li>
<li>Select a security question from the dropdown menu and type your answer.</li>
<li>Click <em>Submit</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When you forget your password</h2>
<p>Aspen has an email-based password recovery system. Clicking <em>I forgot my password</em> on Aspen's login screen will email a new, one-time password to the email you entered upon <a href="#setting-up-your-account-and-security-questions">account creation</a>. If you have tried to log in five times with the wrong password, your account will be locked. Fortunately, clicking on the <em>I forgot my password</em> link and completing that process will unlock your account.</p>
<h1>Passwords and security</h1>
<p>Aspen is our Student Information System and therefore contains a lot of confidential student data. Please treat your password with the highest level of safety and security.</p>
<ul>
<li>When choosing a password, choose something that would be hard for a stranger to guess
<ul>
<li>Good example: CorrectStapleHorseBattery7</li>
<li>Bad example: aspen1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your internet browser offers to save or remember the password, please select <em>Never for this site</em></li>
<li>Do not write down/print out your password on a piece of paper, sticky note, or other physical object and then leave the password taped to your monitor, in a desk drawer, tucked under your computer tower, etc.</li>
</ul>
