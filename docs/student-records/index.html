    </header>

    <section>
    <p>Student records can be viewed from the following navigations (view - top tab):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>School view</em> - <em>Student TT</em></li>
<li><em>Special Education view</em> - <em>Student TT</em></li>
<li><em>Special Education view</em> - <em>IEP TT</em></li>
</ul>
<h1>Active (current) students</h1>
<p>Within School view, you can view active students by selecting the <em>All Active Students</em> filter. Within Special Education view, you can view active students by selecting the <em>Enrollment Status = Active</em> filter. If you would like these filters to be the default way you look at the student lists, see <a href="/basics/filters-and-field-sets/#setting-defaults-for-a-given-page">here for instructions to set default filters and field sets</a>.</p>
<h1>Inactive students</h1>
<p>Across views, you can see previous student records by selecting <em>All Records</em>.</p>
<h1>A note about <em>All Records</em></h1>
<p>As a general rule, if you don't like fiddling back and forth between active and inactive filters, you can always default to using <em>All Records</em> and then using search or sort to find the particular data you're interested in.</p>
<h1>Students currently enrolled in another program</h1>
<p>Typically if a student has been moved to another program you should coordinate with their new teacher or TC, or access them within their new school (if youâ€™re still the current teacher or TC) to make any required updates. However there are some exceptions to this rule. If you find you still need access to a student record and they are not viewable as either an <a href="#active-current-students">active</a> or <a href="#inactive-students">inactive student</a>. Please reach out to an SDL or the SEIS Data Team and we will resolve the issue.</p>
